                    <p>
                        <b>Story:</b> Sukh was one of the lucky ones. He had lived a decent life on the streets with the
                        help
                        of a local feeder of street dogs. Until one day, she noticed he could no longer see. On
                        examination, we found out that he has a mature cataract in his left eye and severe lens
                        laceration in right eye, the reasons behind his partial blindness. We decided not to release him
                        because he couldn’t survive on the busy streets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently he can see partially and eat, sleep and do his business on his own. His vision could
                        improve after eye surgery, but not completely. After discussions as a team and with our head
                        veterinary doctor, we decided not to have Sukh’s eyes operated on locally. Local doctors do not
                        have a lot of experience in doing these kinds of complicated surgeries.

                        Sukh loves to be petted around his neck and rump and to show it he becomes very animated and
                        excited! He makes a funny growling noise when he gets excited and happy. He is such a gem! He
                        walks well outside, he is very curious about his environment. He doesn’t get nervous on the
                        roads. At the shelter he loves getting treats while sitting, going for walks and hiking, and
                        cuddling and playing with the team.
                        He is ok with other dogs around him, but mostly he doesn’t seem to be interested. Sukh would
                        prefer a home without children as he needs to be around humans who respect his boundaries.
